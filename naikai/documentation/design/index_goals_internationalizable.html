<h1>Naikai | Goals | Internationalizable</h1>

<p>
All strings in Naikai will be stored in either UTF-8 or UCS-2 so Naikai
will be fully internationalizable.  I was really surprised at the amount
of people who wished to use non-ASCII characters within their Sphere
games, but Sphere only supported ASCII.
