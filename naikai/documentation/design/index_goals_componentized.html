<h1>Naikai | Goals | Componentized</h1>

<p>
One of the problems that arose in Sphere, was that as the project
progressed, the components became more and more tightly linked.
This means that changing one component meant changing another, which
made adding new features harder and harder each time.
</p>

<p>
Also, most of the Sphere components were written solely in C++, and
I had to do extra work to allow you to access them from a script.
This process will be automated in Naikai, so that you just specify
an interface and any supported language will automatically be able
to use it.
