<h1>Naikai | Components | Graphics</h1>

<p>
Hmmm...  I have lots of ideas, but I haven't really fleshed them out yet.
</p>

<p>
Preliminary thoughts:
<ul>
<li>Only support for hardware acceleration (OpenGL and Direct3D)</li>
<li>Scene graph (fast even in scripting languages?)</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
