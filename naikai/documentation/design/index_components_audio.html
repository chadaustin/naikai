<h1>Naikai | Components | Audio</h1>

<p>
The audio subsystem used in Naikai is split into different sections to clearly
separate the responsibilities and allow for maximum flexibility.  The audio
path is split into [at least] three sections:
</p>

<pre>
               decoder              mixer
               -------              -----

audio file (MP3) -> raw audio data >>
                                     \
audio file (MOD) -> raw audio data >>---->> output audio stream
                                     /
audio file (WAV) -> raw audio data >>
</pre>

<p>
Audio sources are anything that can create raw PCM audio data.  This could be
an MP3 file, a tone generator, or a network stream.  An audio source can also
simply mix other sources or apply a filter to one.
</p>

<p>
Given an input MP3 file, a decoder is required to convert that into usable raw
audio data.  The <a href="http://aegisknight.org/acoustique.html">Acoustique</a>
library handles this functionality for us.
</p>

<p>
Once the audio sources are sending out useful data, they must be mixed and sent
to the sound card.  Since some sound cards have mixers in hardware, the system
will send each audio stream individually to the underlying audio API
(DirectSound in Windows, ALSA or esound in Linux) where it is mixed either in
hardware or by an optimized software mixer.
