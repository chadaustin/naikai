<h1>Naikai | Non-Goals | Specific</h1>

<p>
Naikai will only provide the core functionality for making a game.
All layers that are specific to a certain type of a game (an RPG
maker, for example) will be built on top of the Naikai system.  This
isn't to say such layers won't exist.  I'll have to build some myself
to create the games I want (Battlements and some kind of fantasy
RPG/sidescroller).  But they won't be considered part of the Naikai
system.
</p>

<p>
A side-effect of this componentized design is that others will have
the capability to create their own packages for use on top of Naikai.
I know several people who have expressed interest in building
sidescrollers, so a sidescroller engine on top of Naikai would see
wide usage.
