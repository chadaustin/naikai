<h1>Naikai | Components | Input</h1>

<p>
Naikai's input system will be completely abstract and generic.  The InputSystem
object will provide a set of InputDevice objects.  Each InputDevice will provide a
set of axes and buttons.  For example, a keyboard will have ~100 buttons.  A
standard mouse would provide two buttons and two axes.  Maybe a third axes if the
mouse has a wheel.
</p>

<p>
Naikai will support both the polling and event queue input models.  In the polling
model, the game asks the input device for its current state (whether buttons are
pressed and the current position of an axis) once each frame.   In the event queue
model, the input device pushes events in a queue, and the game processes them (for
example: "U key was pressed, U key was unpressed") periodically.
