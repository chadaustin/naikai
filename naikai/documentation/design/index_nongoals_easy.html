<h1>Naikai | Non-Goals | Easy</h1>

<p>
Naikai will be a very low-level game system.  Therefore, it's not something
anybody can just sit down and use.  You need to have some experience with
software development and preferably a COM- or Java-like system.  This doesn't
mean everything made with Naikai will be hard to use.  I've considered building
a Sphere or VERGE compatibility layer so that you could develop and run games
for legacy game engines.

<p>
On the other hand, I'm writing documentation *before* I code, so the developers
should be happier than they were with Sphere.  :)
