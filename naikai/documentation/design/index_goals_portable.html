<h1>Naikai | Goals | Portable</h1>

<p>
When it comes to software, I like having a choice.  It follows to reason that
I want Naikai to work properly on at least the three major platforms:
Windows, Linux, and MacOS X.  Everybody likes games.  :)

This is not to say you can't make platform-specific components, however.
